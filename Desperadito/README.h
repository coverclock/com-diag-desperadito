ABSTRACT

This file is part of the Digital Aggregates Corporation Desperadito
library. Desperadito is an open source library of object-oriented
software components written in C++. It implements design patterns

Desperado, Diminuto, and Hayloft.

It is licensed under a modified GNU Lesser General Public License
to allow it to be incorporated into proprietary software or
firmware without restriction or viral licensing implication.

Desperado requires

o   ANSI C++ and ANSI C99-compilant compilers,
o   a POSIX-compliant operating system and run-time library, including
o   POSIX threads, and
o   support for 64-bit integral types.
